### MAPPING ASSETS
#### A tutorial

![XKCD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/gdi-webmap/master/img/xkcd.jpg)

This is a tutorial for the [Hive Chicago Buzz 2016](http://www.hivechicagobuzz.org/), 90-min workshop series: some of the most complex questions of access and opportunity can be easily communicated in a 2-D projection of a place. We'll use map tools to help groups connect with communities hyper-locally. The files here use Reveal.js, and it demos map making techniques in CartoDB, MapBox, Google Maps and other platforms/libraries. 

You can see the live presentation here: <http://auremoser.github.io/HCB-mapping>
